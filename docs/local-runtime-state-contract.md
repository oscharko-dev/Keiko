# Local Runtime State Contract

This document enumerates the local paths, environment variables, and durable stores that Keiko
intentionally reads or writes at `0.2.0`. It is a current-state contract, not a historical rollout
or compatibility playbook.

## Principles

- Explicit CLI flags override environment variables; environment variables override defaults.
- Secrets enter through local config, local environment, or explicit local setup flows only.
- UI database and memory-vault configured paths use fail-closed validation; path escapes and
  symlink-based bypasses are rejected.
- Evidence and memory remain local machine state; neither is a hosted service.

## Inventory

| Surface | Resolution | Owner | Notes |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| Gateway config file | `--config` → `KEIKO_CONFIG_FILE` → sibling `keiko.config.json` next to the resolved UI DB path | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-cli`, `@oscharko-dev/keiko-server` | JSON config; may contain provider secrets. |
| Gateway credentials | `KEIKO_DEFAULT_*` and `KEIKO_MODEL_<ID>_*` environment variables | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-security`, `@oscharko-dev/keiko-server` | Read from local environment; not written back by Keiko. |
| UI database | `--ui-db` or `KEIKO_UI_DATA_DIR/keiko-ui.db` or `~/.keiko/keiko-ui.db` | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-server` | Local SQLite store for UI state. |
| Evidence directory | `--evidence-dir` or `KEIKO_EVIDENCE_DIR` or `./.keiko/evidence/` | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-evidence` | Redacted JSON manifests and related local evidence files. |
| Consumer package scripts | `keiko:start`, `keiko:stop` in the consumer `package.json` | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-cli` | Written by `keiko init`. |
| Lifecycle files | `KEIKO_STATE_DIR/ui.pid` and `KEIKO_STATE_DIR/ui.log` or default `.keiko/` | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-cli` | Runtime-only process state. |
| Local `.env` discovery | Current working directory `.env` for `KEIKO_*` keys | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-cli` | Read-only convenience surface. |
| Memory vault | `memoryDir` → `KEIKO_MEMORY_DIR` → `KEIKO_STATE_DIR/memory/keiko-memory.db` → `~/.keiko/memory/keiko-memory.db` | `@oscharko-dev/keiko-memory-vault` and related memory packages | Local SQLite STRICT/WAL store; workspace-local paths are rejected. |

## Precedence ladders

| Surface | Precedence |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Gateway config | `--config` → `KEIKO_CONFIG_FILE` → sibling `keiko.config.json` |
| UI DB | explicit option → `KEIKO_UI_DATA_DIR/keiko-ui.db` → `~/.keiko/keiko-ui.db` |
| Evidence dir | `--evidence-dir` → `KEIKO_EVIDENCE_DIR` → `./.keiko/evidence/` |
| Lifecycle state | `--state-dir` → `KEIKO_STATE_DIR` → `.keiko/` |
| Memory vault | `memoryDir` → `KEIKO_MEMORY_DIR` → `KEIKO_STATE_DIR/memory/` → `~/.keiko/memory/` |

## Boundary notes

- Environment-variable values remain customer-owned configuration. Keiko reads them; it does not
  silently re-home or re-export them.
- Evidence is redacted before persistence and stored separately from UI durable state.
- Memory audit events are persisted without raw memory bodies or payloads.
- Historical upgrade evidence for earlier package layouts is intentionally not repeated here; this
  page is limited to the current 0.2.0 runtime contract.
